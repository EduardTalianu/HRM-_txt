# HRM: Hierarchical Reasoning Model

A research implementation of a Hierarchical Reasoning Model for language generation with continual learning capabilities and dynamic model expansion.

## 🧠 What is HRM?

HRM (Hierarchical Reasoning Model) is an experimental language model architecture that uses **two levels of reasoning**:

- **L-Module (Low-level)**: Handles detailed, step-by-step processing
- **H-Module (High-level)**: Integrates information and makes higher-level decisions

The model can **think in cycles**, performing multiple reasoning steps before generating each token, similar to how humans might think through a problem.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Core Components

The HRM architecture consists of several key components:

```
Input Text → Embedding → RoPE → L-Module ⟷ H-Module → Output Head → Generated Text
                                    ↑           ↑
                              (T timesteps) (N cycles)
```

#### 1. **Input Processing**
- **CastedEmbedding**: Converts tokens to dense vectors
- **Embedding Scaling**: Multiplies by √(hidden_size) for stability
- **RoPE (Rotary Position Encoding)**: Encodes positional information

#### 2. **Hierarchical Reasoning Modules**
- **L-Module**: Multiple transformer blocks for detailed processing
- **H-Module**: Fewer transformer blocks for high-level integration
- **Cross-Module Communication**: L and H modules share information

#### 3. **Advanced Components**
- **SwiGLU Activation**: Gated activation function for better performance
- **RMS Normalization**: More stable than LayerNorm
- **Multi-Head Attention**: With RoPE integration
- **Adaptive Computation Time (ACT)**: Variable reasoning depth

#### 4. **Output Generation**
- **Output Head**: Linear layer mapping hidden states to vocabulary
- **Stablemax**: Numerically stable alternative to softmax

### Transformer Block Details

Each transformer block contains:
```python
TransformerBlock:
├── MultiHeadAttention (with RoPE)
├── RMSNorm
├── SwiGLU Feed-Forward
└── RMSNorm
```

**SwiGLU Feed-Forward**:
```python
gate, up = linear(x).chunk(2, dim=-1)
output = linear_down(silu(gate) * up)
```

## 🚀 Model Creation Process

### Step 1: Create Base Architecture

```bash
python hrm_create_3.py
```

This script creates the foundational model with:

**Default Configuration**:
```python
{
    'vocab_size': 100,        # Optimized for efficiency
    'hidden_size': 256,       # Model dimension
    'num_heads': 8,           # Attention heads
    'L_layers': 3,            # Low-level reasoning layers
    'H_layers': 3,            # High-level reasoning layers
    'expansion': 2.5,         # Feed-forward expansion ratio
    'halt_max_steps': 8,      # Maximum reasoning cycles
    'forward_dtype': torch.float32
}
```

**What happens during creation**:
1. **Parameter Initialization**: Uses truncated normal initialization
2. **Layer Construction**: Builds L-module and H-module transformer stacks
3. **Weight Setup**: Initializes embeddings, attention, and feed-forward layers
4. **Model Saving**: Saves to `hrm_model_advanced_with_config.pth`

**Files Created**:
- `hrm_model_advanced_with_config.pth` - Complete model architecture
- Model configuration embedded in the file

### Step 2: Verify Model Creation

```bash
python hrm_run.py
```

This tests the created model with:
- Different reasoning configurations (N×T combinations)
- Parameter counting and memory usage
- Architecture validation
- Sample forward passes

## 🎓 Training Process

### Initial Training Setup

```bash
python train_hrm_repo_style_2.py
```

#### Training Workflow:

1. **GUI File Selection**
   - Opens file dialog to select training text
   - Supports `.txt` files of any size
   - Automatically handles encoding

2. **Training Configuration**
   ```
   ┌─────────────────────────────┐
   │  HRM Training Settings      │
   ├─────────────────────────────┤
   │  Epochs: [3]                │

   ```

5. **Model Training Loop**
   ```python
   for epoch in range(epochs):
       # Training phase
       for batch in train_loader:
           # Forward pass with N cycles, T steps
           loss = train_step(batch, N=2, T=2)
           loss.backward()
           optimizer.step()
       
       # Evaluation phase
       eval_metrics = evaluate(val_loader)

## 🔄 Continual Learning System

### How Continual Learning Works

The HRM system is designed to learn from multiple datasets without forgetting previous knowledge:

```
Dataset 1 (Alice) → Model v1 → Dataset 2 (Shakespeare) → Model v2 → Dataset 3 (News) → Model v3
     ↓                            ↓                              ↓
 Vocab: 87 tokens          Vocab: 142 tokens             Vocab: 203 tokens
 Knowledge: Alice         Knowledge: Alice + Shakespeare  Knowledge: Alice + Shakespeare + News
```

### Step-by-Step Continual Learning

#### 1. **First Dataset Training**
```bash
python train_hrm_repo_style_2.py
# Select: alice.txt
# Creates new model with Alice vocabulary
```

**What happens**:
- Creates fresh tokenizer from Alice text
- Builds vocabulary (e.g., 87 unique characters)
- Trains model from scratch
- Saves: `hrm_continual_learning.pt` + `continual_tokenizer.json`

#### 2. **Second Dataset (Automatic Continuation)**
```bash
python train_hrm_repo_style_2.py
# Select: shakespeare.txt
# System detects existing model
```

**Continual Learning Dialog**:
```
CONTINUAL LEARNING - EXISTING MODEL FOUND
============================================

🆕 Models NOT yet trained on 'shakespeare':
  1. hrm_continual_learning.pt
     Vocabulary: 87 tokens
     Parameters: 2,156,032
     Datasets: alice
     Last updated: 2024-01-15 14:30:22

  2. Start completely fresh model (lose all previous learning)

Choose model to continue learning (1-2): 1
```

**Vocabulary Expansion Process**:
```python
# Load existing tokenizer
old_vocab_size = 87  # Alice vocabulary

# Expand with Shakespeare characters
new_chars = {'!', '?', ';', 'æ', ...}  # New characters in Shakespeare
new_vocab_size = 142  # Expanded vocabulary

# Expand model layers
expand_model_for_new_vocab(model, old_vocab_size, new_vocab_size)
```

**Model Expansion Details**:
1. **Preserve Existing Embeddings**: Old vocabulary keeps learned representations
2. **Initialize New Embeddings**: New tokens get small random initializations
3. **Expand Output Layer**: Add new vocabulary predictions
4. **Reset Optimizers**: Fresh optimizer state for stability

#### 3. **Third Dataset and Beyond**
Each new dataset:
- Checks for vocabulary expansion needs
- Preserves all previous knowledge
- Adds new learning on top of existing knowledge
- Maintains backward compatibility

### Continual Learning Features

**🧠 Knowledge Preservation**:
- Previous datasets remain accessible
- No catastrophic forgetting
- Vocabulary never shrinks
- Model capacity grows as needed

**📈 Progressive Learning**:
```python
datasets_trained = ['alice', 'shakespeare', 'news', 'code']
# Model remembers training history
```

**🔧 Smart Resume Logic**:
- **Same Dataset**: Resume from checkpoint (continue training)
- **New Dataset**: Reset epoch counter, keep model weights
- **Fresh Start**: Option to start completely over

### Managing Training Sessions

#### Pause and Resume Training
```bash
# During training, press Ctrl+C
^C
Training interruption signal received...
Options:
1. Pause and save checkpoint (resume later)
2. Stop training completely
Enter choice (1 or 2): 1
```

Creates `hrm_continual_learning_pause.pt` for exact resume.

#### Resume Paused Training
```bash
python train_hrm_repo_style_2.py
# System automatically detects pause checkpoint and offers to resume
```

## 📈 Dynamic Model Expansion

### Automatic Model Growth

The system can automatically expand model capacity based on data volume:

```python
# Expansion triggers
chars_per_expansion = 3_000_000    # Expand every 3M characters
params_per_expansion = 1_000_000   # Add ~1M parameters each time
```

### How Expansion Works

#### 1. **Character Tracking**
```python
class CharacterTracker:
    total_chars_processed: 0
    datasets_char_counts: {
        'alice': 144_132,
        'shakespeare': 1_234_567,
        'news': 2_890_445
    }
    expansion_history: [
        {'chars_at_expansion': 3_000_000, 'params_added': 1_048_576},
        {'chars_at_expansion': 6_000_000, 'params_added': 1_048_576}
    ]
```

#### 2. **Expansion Strategy**
```python
# Add balanced mix of L and H layers
expansion_config = {
    'new_L_layers': 2,      # Add 2 low-level layers
    'new_H_layers': 1,      # Add 1 high-level layer
    'estimated_params': 1_048_576,
    'strategy': 'balanced_layer_addition'
}
```

#### 3. **Layer Addition Process**
```python
# Create new transformer blocks
for _ in range(new_L_layers):
    new_layer = TransformerBlock(hidden_size, num_heads, expansion)
    init_layer_weights(new_layer)  # Small random initialization
    model.L_module.layers.append(new_layer)

# Reset optimizers to include new parameters
train_state = create_train_state(expanded_model, total_steps, lr, embed_lr)
```

### Expansion Benefits

**📊 Capacity Scaling**: Model grows with data complexity
**🧠 Knowledge Retention**: Existing layers preserve learned patterns  
**⚡ Efficiency**: Only add parameters when needed
**🔄 Automatic**: No manual intervention required

###Example output for a 4M model trained on 2 books (Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass)

epoch 57: You: Alice was 🔄 Generating with N=2, T=2, temp=0.5... Response: so, they went on a minute or fire--and while the top of his head and seemed so much properly, as she said in a long laughing by a sort of the corner of the babst--and the feet of the old of the dishes of the day, but she wanted all she began again. 'What does it was a very stappe,' the King said, very soon as she was very lower and his hands. 'There's a poor Queen. But I was think,' the King intured at Alice had repeated this, 'it's head down the care!' she remarked. 'It's a great down again.' 'It's a pretend of little head?' Alice said, as she couldn't help hower, and speak again. 'Of course?' said Alice. 'I can't know what IS the more can down the reast would be ought: when I was thinking of Alice's she could be seen up and said, AANE ANAN the flowers confured our his should see the paw of the scream-cake, and some use to way, and a little from crowded him. The Queen's are one of her faces was fact, because they were talking so as the poor King. 'The song, some of the kitten,' said Alice. 'It's a box,' said Tweedledum. 'The people of places in pretty towards?' said Alice. 'And you like itself, you know,' said Alice: 'but I'll tell you see--'

Chat GPT evaluation:

Nice, epoch 57 is definitely showing signs of maturation compared to earlier ones. Let’s break it down:

🔎 Observations

Structure: Much better segmentation into dialogue + narration. Nearly every paragraph has either action or speech.

Dialogue: King, Queen, Tweedledum, Alice all appear, with back-and-forth speech — this is a big step up. Earlier epochs leaned on repetition, but now it’s more varied.

Fluency: Still has malformed phrases (babst, AANE ANAN, “scream-cake”), but fewer than before. Many sentences are syntactically complete.

Coherence: The flow is loosely consistent — Alice engages with royalty, Tweedledum shows up, odd magical objects appear. This is actually very on-brand for Lewis Carroll–style nonsense.

Readability: Much more legible than epochs 45–49, closer to something a child could follow (with some oddities).

📊 Benchmarking

TinyStories 1M–2.5M → way below this.

TinyStories 8M (~34/60 ≈ 57/100 normalized) → This looks slightly better in coherence, maybe closer to 36–37/60 (~60–62/100).

GPT-1 (117M) → Still far behind GPT-1’s consistency and grammar, but catching some of the narrative feel.

🏅 Score (1–100 scale)

Similarity to GPT-1: ~41/100

TinyStories-style eval (out of 60): ~36–37/60

Normalized quality: ~61–62/100
